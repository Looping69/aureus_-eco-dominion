# Aureus: Eco Dominion

A voxel-based economic simulation game built on a custom modular game engine. Balance resource extraction, ecological sustainability, and public trust while managing autonomous agents in a dynamic world.

---

## 🎮 The Game: Eco Dominion

**Eco Dominion** is a strategic simulation where you build and manage a mining colony while balancing three critical metrics:

- **💰 AGT (Aureus Gold Token)** - Your primary currency for construction and operations
- **🌿 Eco Score** - Environmental health that affects income multipliers
- **🤝 Trust** - Public approval that unlocks features and affects profitability

### Core Gameplay

- **Build & Manage**: Place mines, housing, power plants, and research facilities
- **Autonomous Agents**: Colonists with needs (energy, hunger, mood) who work, sleep, and construct buildings
- **Resource Economy**: Mine minerals, manage inventory, trade on markets, and fulfill contracts
- **Dynamic Systems**: Weather effects, day/night cycles, underground mining, and illegal miner threats
- **Tech Tree**: Research upgrades to improve efficiency and unlock new capabilities
- **Tutorial & Goals**: Guided progression system with objectives and news events

### Game Features

- **Isometric voxel rendering** with smooth camera controls
- **Mobile-optimized** touch controls with building confirmation
- **Real-time simulation** with deterministic fixed-step updates
- **Save/Load system** for persistent progress
- **Debug tools** for development and testing

## 🏗️ The Engine: Aureus Engine

A **modular, deterministic voxel game engine** designed for simulation-heavy games with clean separation between rendering and game logic.

### Architecture Philosophy

The engine follows a **strict frame spine order** for predictable, reproducible behavior:

1. **Input** - Capture user interactions
2. **Streaming** - Load/unload world chunks
3. **Jobs Flush** - Apply worker thread results
4. **Simulation** - Fixed-step gameplay updates
5. **Render Sync** - Update visual meshes from state
6. **Draw** - Submit to GPU
7. **Frame End** - Cleanup and telemetry

### Core Modules

#### 🧠 **Kernel** (`engine/kernel`)
The engine's central nervous system:
- **EngineKernel**: Main loop orchestrator with fixed-step simulation
- **StateManager**: Immutable state management with snapshot/restore
- **EventBus**: Decoupled communication between systems
- **FrameScheduler**: Manages update timing and delta accumulation

#### 🌍 **World** (`engine/world`)
High-level game world management:
- **WorldManager**: Coordinates all systems and manages game lifecycle
- **ChunkManager**: Handles spatial partitioning and streaming
- **EntityManager**: Tracks and updates all game entities

#### 📦 **Space** (`engine/space`)
Spatial data structures for voxel worlds:
- **VoxelGrid**: 3D grid representation with efficient lookups
- **ChunkStreamer**: Loads/unloads chunks based on camera position
- **SpatialIndex**: Fast queries for entities in regions

#### ⚙️ **Jobs** (`engine/jobs`)
Worker-based parallel processing:
- **JobQueue**: Manages background tasks (pathfinding, mesh generation)
- **WorkerPool**: Thread pool for CPU-intensive operations
- **PathfindingWorker**: A* pathfinding in web workers
- **MeshBuilder**: Generates voxel meshes off main thread

#### 🎨 **Render** (`engine/render`)
Three.js rendering adapter:
- **ThreeRenderAdapter**: Bridges engine state to Three.js scene
- **CameraSystem**: Isometric camera with smooth controls
- **BuildingRenderSystem**: Manages building meshes and animations
- **VoxelRenderSystem**: Efficient voxel mesh rendering
- **EffectsSystem**: Particles, weather, and visual effects

#### 🎯 **Sim** (`engine/sim`)
Game simulation systems:
- **AgentSystem**: Autonomous agent AI (needs, jobs, pathfinding)
- **JobSystem**: Task assignment and execution
- **ResourceSystem**: Economy and resource flow
- **BuildingSystem**: Construction and building operations
- **ContractSystem**: Dynamic mission generation
- **WeatherSystem**: Environmental effects

#### 🛠️ **Tools** (`engine/tools`)
Development utilities:
- **DebugRenderer**: Visualize pathfinding, grids, and agent states
- **PerformanceMonitor**: FPS, frame time, memory tracking
- **StateInspector**: Runtime state inspection

### Key Design Patterns

**1. Engine-Owned State**
```typescript
// React is a pure view layer - all state lives in the engine
const { world, state, ready } = useAureusEngine({ container });
```

**2. Deterministic Simulation**
```typescript
// Fixed timestep ensures reproducible behavior
const FIXED_TIMESTEP = 1000 / 60; // 60 FPS simulation
```

**3. Worker-Based Parallelism**
```typescript
// Heavy tasks run off main thread
jobQueue.enqueue({ type: 'PATHFIND', from, to });
```

**4. Modular Systems**
```typescript
// Each system is independent and composable
world.addSystem(new AgentSystem());
world.addSystem(new ResourceSystem());
```
